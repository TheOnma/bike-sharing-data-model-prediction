## Business Problem Statement

### Challenge Overview
Bike sharing companies face significant operational challenges in predicting customer demand across different time periods and locations. Inefficient demand forecasting leads to:

- **Resource Misallocation**: Bikes unavailable when and where customers need them
- **Revenue Loss**: Missed opportunities during high-demand periods
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Suboptimal bike redistribution and maintenance scheduling
- **Customer Dissatisfaction**: Poor service availability affecting user retention
- **Cost Overruns**: Excessive inventory or inadequate supply planning

### Business Impact
Poor demand prediction directly affects:
- **Customer Experience**: Service unavailability during peak times
- **Financial Performance**: Lost revenue and increased operational costs
- **Market Competitiveness**: Inability to meet customer expectations vs competitors
- **Scalability**: Challenges in expanding to new markets without demand insights
